# Drubs

Drubs (short for "Drupal Build System") is a command-line tool for building,
deploying, and managing Drupal sites across multiple servers and environments
such as development, testing, staging, and production.  It is:

* free - open source, GNU GPL
* flexible - specify or script every detail of your project, however you want
* repeatable - add, update, remove, and rebuild exact copies of your project
* distributed - trigger builds and updates on any servers, from anywhere
* integratable - use Drubs with shell scripts, Jenkins/Hudson, Travis CI, or
    any other continuous integration tools

The "Drubs" name is a hat-tip to the indespensible Drush.  Drupal is a
registered trademark of Dries Buytaert.
